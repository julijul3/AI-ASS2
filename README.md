# AI ASSIGNMENT 2
BELIEF REVISION

To write input:

All formulae has to be of the form 
(p v q)
p
¬p

i.e: 
- if theres an operator, always have space around it and parenthesis around the operands.
- a litteral is just a string, DO NOT surround it with parenthesis
- if theres a negation, do not insert space between the negation and the literal

The available operators are:
<->, ->, v, ^, ¬

When writing into the Belief Base, add a formula per line. Add an empty line (press enter twice) when you're done.
